Your BVN is a code attached to your details -- your name, fingerprint, date of birth, and a photo of your face. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) uses those details to protect your identity from people who may want to pretend they are you, so they can steal your money in your name.

Kuda requires your BVN because:
- They are following the CBN's orders.
- They are making sure that you are who you say you are. When you give your BVN, they run a check on the general BVN registry to make sure the number you typed is correct and yours.
